### Location Simulation

- Supports simulated location using provided `.gpx` files via Xcodeâ€™s Debug > Simulate Location.

---

## Architecture

- **Model:** `DiningHall` struct with `id`, `name`, `isCollected`, and CLLocation.
- **ViewModel:** `DiningHallViewModel` tracks collected halls and business logic.
- **Views:** SwiftUI-based UI with `HomeView` and `DiningHallView`, sharing state via `@Environment` and a centralized `DiningHallViewModel`.

---

## How to Run

1. Open `PennDiningScavengerHunt.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Run on a simulator or real device.
3. Simulate a dining hall location using `Debug > Simulate Location > Add GPX File to Project...`.
4. Tap on a dining hall in the list and shake the device to collect it.

## Notes

- Progress is not persisted across app launches.
- Coordinates are hardcoded using `Locations.swift`.
